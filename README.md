# Bridging Discretionary Intuition and Systematic Trading Frameworks

The objective of this repository is to document the process of transforming discretionary trading insights into formalized, rule-based trading strategies.

The focus is on formalizing technical analysis, market intuition, and discretionary reasoning into measurable and repeatable rules. This is achieved through a layered research process that involves designing the strategy framework, iteratively refining parameters, improving robustness, and evaluating performance across different market conditions and regimes.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main research areas: strategy development and empirical validation.

### Strategy Research

The [strategies](./strategies) branch represents the conceptual laboratory where trading strategies are designed and developed. This section documents the underlying methodology and trading philosophy, detailing how discretionary market insights are translated into structured signal hierarchies that ultimately drive execution.

The research process begins with the analysis of different market structures. Strategies are then classified into main families according to how they exploit market behavior and how execution logic is designed. Emphasis is placed on clarity of assumptions, signal construction, and coherence between market structure, strategy logic, and execution.

### Case Studies and Empirical Validation

The [case-studies](./case_studies) branch represents the empirical laboratory. Here, trading strategies are backtested, optimized, and progressively improved using historical data.

Strategies are applied across different markets and environments with the objective of identifying the conditions under which each strategy delivers robust outperformance relative to its benchmark. The emphasis is not on over-optimization, but on understanding where, why, and under which market regimes a strategy performs effectively.

## Research Philosophy

This repository is intended as a research framework rather than a collection of isolated strategies. The guiding principle is to bridge discretionary intuition and systematic formalization, combining qualitative insight with quantitative discipline in order to build scalable, interpretable, and robust trading systems.
