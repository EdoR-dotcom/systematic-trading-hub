# Bridging Discretionary Intuition and Systematic Trading Frameworks
This repository documents my process of transforming discretionary trading insights into formalized, rule-based trading strategies.

I engineer technical analysis into systematic trading frameworks, develop trading algorithms, and backtest their performance.

The objective is to translate intuition into measurable rules, iteratively refine parameters, improve robustness, and evaluate strategies across different market conditions.
