## Trading Strategies

This section contains systematic trading strategies derived from discretionary insights
and formalized into rule-based frameworks.

Strategies are organized by conceptual family:

- Trend-following and moving average strategies
- Breakout strategies
- Mean reversion strategies

Each strategy includes:
- a clear trading logic
- parameter definitions
- backtesting methodology
- performance metrics and evaluation



### Execution Classification

The strategy operates with two execution types: breakout entries and pullback entries.


Breakout entries

A breakout is defined as a confirmed structural shift in which price exits a prior balance regime and establishes directional behavior.


Pull Back entries

We distinguish between breakout pullbacks, which occur after a structural break followed by a retest, and trend pullbacks, defined as short-term counter-moves within an established directional regime. Not all trend corrections qualify as pullbacks.

Our strategies operate exclusively on Type 1 (breakout pullbacks) and Type 2 (trend pullbacks). Type 3 corrections represent potential primary trend shifts and therefore require a separate analytical framework, including Elliott Wave Theory.
